We even reissued two IDs at one point, and clipped any of his old IDs we can find since they are no longer valid. That is why I'm installing a new lock so that if this person loses his ID once again, he no longer can enter or exit this lab. We have one more subject coming for a total of three so I'm going to get this straight with any new subjects.</i></p>
