		  			"That man who wrote that note... he knew about this door... But he didn't give a single hint of how to open this damned thing!!"

							The man faces you and points a small gun at you. A twisted look is on his face.

							"So, let's make this easy for the both of us. There's no point going forward, right? We're... trapped. Even through these puzzles, I had already lost someone I met here. He had hoped to escape, but I was scared that I would meet the same fate..."
						</p>
						<p>
							"Yes, now... the real escape isn't what's here... it's Hell we should escape into!"
