						<div id="dropdown11" class="dropdown-content">
							<p>"Hmm, is that something stuck on the back of the binder?"</p>
							<p>Looking at the back, a page was attached almost seemlessly, blending in with the white binder. You peeled off the sheet and read it:</p>
						 	<i>
						 		<p>If you can see this page, then I am a survivor of the Tomb. I have already solved the puzzle in this room and wanted to leave a hint for those also trapped here. There are other people here other than the "participants" of this game. They are watching your every move. And everytime you solve a puzzle, they will lock the room and change the puzzle's answer, to make it much more difficult. There is a way to escape death after you escaped from the Tomb. I just don't know how to get there, but it should be after this room. For now, the way to solve this puzzle is to exclude numbers from an extremely large number. The number and method of finding them will surely change after I leave here, but I wish you luck.</p>
						 	</i>
						 	<p>"There are... people watching us? I figured whoever is running this show is watching us, but <i>people?</i> What's going on here...? Forget it, at least we know the puzzle now."</p>
						 	<p>The man is looking very troubled.</p>
