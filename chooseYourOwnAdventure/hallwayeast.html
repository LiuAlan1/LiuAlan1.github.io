					As you inputted the answer into the keypad, the door clicks open and you open the door with ease.

				<p>
					Exiting the room, you are greeted with white hallways that seemed to span endlessly. The door locks behind you as soon as you step out.

			  		Moving forward, there is nothing attention worthy as you walk forward. You seem to hear something as you seemed to approach a branching corridor.

				  			"Thank you. It's nice having someone with me. I know where the door is so follow me."

							Walking down the hall, following the man, you see a large double door. On each side is a red button.

							"Are you ready? On three, ok?" The man motioned you to the left while he moved to the right.
