		  		You wake up in total darkness. It feels as if every part of your body has been numb for an extremely long time.
		  		Upon waking up you hear a voice.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		  		"Hello. Welcome to The Tomb. You are a prisoner. If you wish to escape, then try to do so. But fail The Tomb's riddles even once and meet death.
		  		Still, do you wish to escape, starting from this very room?"
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		  		You wonder what the person was talking about. But as you think, you realize that you can't remember anything. How did you get here? And what is The Tomb? In total curiosity, you got up.
